# RandomForest_decisionTree
Accuracy is around 0.75. The highest time is 0.7679

Implemented decisionTree and random forest model in machine learning with python, with approach of Information Gain.

random_forest.py is used as the running function.
decision_tree.py is used to implement decision tree classifier.
util.py is used to calculate entropy, information gain and partition classes.

hw4-data is used to train the model and test it.
